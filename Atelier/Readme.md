Use Atelier (eclipse plug-in) to do source control on .cls files.

Step 1. Choose which eclipse.
C:\Site\eclipse-P\R\JS+AR\eclipse\eclipse.exe Photon June 2018
That's kinda old.
Workspace: C:\Users\VHAORLBadgeB\eclipse-workspace\HS\PR-JS+AR
There's a "fix" for Atelier to allow it to open .bpl files.
